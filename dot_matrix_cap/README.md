The Berkeley Cal logo is kept in program memory as a bitmap array with 520 uint16_t's. Color correction has been done to make the colors accurate. Bounces around the screen like the DVD logo.

Considering adding in some type of loading animation: The yellow border could be drawn in rather than just appearing, same with the blue background.

Planning on adding in bluetooth functionality so that parameters could be changed: The dx and dy speeds could be variable, the delay between frames could also be variable. Bluetooth could allow for switching between animations.

Considering adding in a splash screen with an enlarged version of the Berkeley logo as a static image.
