Simple bluetooth communicator between an ESP32 and a smartphone

Upon uploading and running on the ESP32, can connect with a smartphone using a Serial Bluetooth Terminal (Kai Morich made one on the Google Play Store)

Whatever is typed in the terminal on the IDE will be communicated to the teminal on the smartphone and vice versa

On my ESP32 MPU (Adafruit HUZZAH32 Feather), the GPIO pin for the onboard LED was pin 13. Typing a 1 or a 0 on the smartphone bluetooth terminal turns the onboard LED on or off respectively
